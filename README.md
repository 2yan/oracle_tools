Tools to connect to ERP and PBCS using Python


## These provide a starting point for connecting to Oracle's Cloud Platform. 

### PBCS
For PBCS, the automation is done through a combination of epm automate and python. 


### ERP
It's all python only, using either the REST API or the SOAP api. 

I would reccomend using these scripts as a starting point to help deal with setting up an API integration. Beyond that it's between you and Oracle's docs.
